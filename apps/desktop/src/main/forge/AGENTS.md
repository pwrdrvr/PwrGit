# forge — AGENTS.md

Which hosting product a repo's `origin` points at, and how to ask it for
change-request status. `PrService` (in `../github/`) is the only consumer; it
speaks `PrSummary` and never learns which forge answered.

- **The seam is `ForgeProvider`** (`types.ts`): four methods — token, branches,
  commits, numbers. That is exactly what `PrService` used to inject as four
  loose functions, which is why the service body did not change. Add a forge by
  implementing those four, not by touching the service.
- **`ForgeRepo.path` is one string, deliberately.** A GitLab project can live at
  any depth (`pwrdrvr/qa/forge/PwrGit-Test`), so `{owner, repo}` cannot hold it.
  GitHub paths are always exactly one slash and `githubOwnerAndName()` splits
  them back for GraphQL. A flat test repo will hide a regression here — use a
  nested one.
- **Return an entry for every key requested.** An explicit `null` is what makes
  a branch or commit negative-cache; omitting the key makes the service refetch
  it forever. `withNullsForMissing()` does this. The one deliberate exception is
  a *failed* commit lookup, which is omitted so a network blip is not cached as
  "no MR".
- **Host detection can't be certain** (`resolve.ts`). The two SaaS hostnames and
  a `gitlab.*` prefix are all we can know; anything else needs an explicit
  override, and until then resolution returns null and the feature no-ops —
  the same best-effort behavior as before this module existed.
- **`cli-runner.ts` is the audited `gh`/`glab` process spawner** — no inherited
  TTY, no prompt, bounded output, and credentials never reaching a diagnostic.
  It is `gh-cli.ts`'s former body with the brand-specific parts lifted into a
  `CliSpec`. Change behavior here, not in a copy; `../github/gh-cli.test.ts`
  covers it and must keep passing.

## GitLab specifics

- **Batching is native, not aliased.** `mergeRequests(sourceBranches: [...])`
  takes a list, so one field replaces GitHub's ~50 aliases. The response is a
  flat list, so grouping per branch and filling nulls are ours to do.
- **`iid` arrives as a GraphQL String** even though it is an integer, while REST
  sends a number. Everything goes through `toSummary`'s `toNumber`.
- **State vocabulary is lowercase and has a fourth value.** `locked` is a live
  MR with discussion locked and maps to `open`; treating it as terminal would
  stop refreshes. `draft` is a real boolean — never parse a `WIP:` title.
- **Commit association has no batch API.** One REST call per SHA at bounded
  concurrency, capped per refresh, with a smaller retry budget than the branch
  query — otherwise an outage over 60 commits backs off for minutes on the
  hover path. The `commit_pr` cache is what keeps this cheap.
- **No schema migration was needed.** `branch_pr`/`commit_pr` already store only
  `number/url/title/state/is_draft`, which is forge-agnostic.

## Test fixture

`pwrdrvr/qa/forge/PwrGit-Test` (private, gitlab.com) exists to exercise this:
a deliberately nested 4-segment path, plus MRs `!1`–`!6` covering opened, draft,
closed, merged, squash-merged, and conflicting, and a branch with no MR at all.

Note that the **imported** `pwrdrvr/PwrGit` mirror is *not* a substitute: its
MRs carry no `merge_commit_sha`/`squash_commit_sha`, so mainline commits there
resolve to no MR and would look like a bug in this code. Use it only for
branch→MR at scale.
