## Hover-opened popups go through `useHoverIntent`

Every SHA chip sits in the same fixed column, so a pointer crossing the graph
enters every trigger on its way elsewhere. Opening on raw `onMouseEnter` leaves
a trail of cards (and fires per-row IPC). `hoverIntent.ts` gates the **pointer**
path on dwell *and* pointer speed; focus and click bypass it.

Wire a new hover popup with `hoverIntentHandlers({ intent, show, hide })` rather
than hand-rolling the four handlers — it is the tested routing:

```tsx
const chip = hoverIntentHandlers({ intent: hoverIntent, show, hide });
<span onMouseEnter={(e) => chip.onMouseEnter(e.currentTarget)}
      onMouseLeave={chip.onMouseLeave}
      onFocus={(e) => chip.onFocus(e.currentTarget)}
      onBlur={chip.onBlur} />
```

Read `e.currentTarget` **synchronously** into the call, as above. The open is
deferred, and React nulls `currentTarget` once the handler returns.

Components that render one gate for many rows (`LineageGraph`) own the hook and
pass the `HoverIntent` down; a lone chip may call `useHoverIntent()` itself.
When a popup outlives the hover that opened it (an interactive card the pointer
moves into), tell the gate with `cardClosed()` when it leaves the screen, or its
"user is browsing" warm window expires while the card is still being read.

Still ungated by choice: `CopyTarget`, `RepoRow`'s refresh tooltip, and
`WorktreeRow`'s PR prefetch on hover.
