# Clear the two kinds of state a previous job leaves behind on the persistent
# macOS E2E guest: orphaned Electron process trees, and macOS saved
# application state for the Electron bundle. Report what was found either way.
#
# The macOS Desktop E2E lane runs on a persistent Tart guest, not a fresh VM
# per job, so anything a previous job left behind survives into the next one.
# An interrupted test can leave Electron helper processes alive after the
# main process exits.
#
# Of the two, the saved application state is the one tied to an observed
# failure — see clear_saved_application_state below. The process reap is
# hygiene: a healthy runner starts a job with zero leftovers, so a non-zero
# count is evidence worth surfacing, and starting a job with orphans is wrong
# regardless. Note that force-killing an Electron is itself what creates the
# saved-state trigger, so the reap must not ship without the state clearing.
#
# Scope, because this machine is shared:
#   * The runner group is shared with PwrSnap, and an operator may be working
#     on the guest. A bare `pkill -f Electron` would take out their work.
#   * Only processes whose command line lives under this runner's own
#     RUNNER_WORKSPACE are eligible. A runner executes one job at a time, so
#     everything matching that path at pre-run time is a leftover, and nothing
#     belonging to PwrSnap or to the operator can match it.
#   * Electron found elsewhere on the guest is counted for the log and left
#     completely alone.
#   * This script runs before the lane launches anything, and it excludes its
#     own process tree, so it cannot kill the current job's processes.
#   * Every pid is re-checked against the scope immediately before it is
#     signalled, so a pid that exits and gets recycled between the scan and
#     the kill cannot be hit by mistake.
#
# Test seams (see macos-e2e-pre-run-cleanup.test.mjs):
#   REAP_PS_SNAPSHOT_FILE  Read the process table from this file instead of
#                          running ps. Forces report-only mode: with an
#                          injected table the script signals nothing.
#   REAP_SELF_PID          Override the pid used for self-exclusion.
#   REAP_STATE_HOME        Look for saved application state under this
#                          directory instead of $HOME, and never touch
#                          cfprefsd defaults. Lets the destructive delete run
#                          against a throwaway tree under test; without it a
#                          report-only run deletes nothing at all.
